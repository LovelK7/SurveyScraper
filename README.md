# Why?

Currently, most commonly used digital cave survey apps (TopoDroid, Qave and PocketTopo) do not offer an export option for survey legs alone; instead, they export all data, including legs and splays. This necessitates post-processing in spreadsheet software, such as Excel. Additionally, while magnetic declination correction can be included, these tools do not calculate it for you, requiring you to use third-party software or an online calculator. This code performs this task for you, enabling you to process survey data more efficiently after every cave survey trip and obtain cave dimensions by a couple of clicks.

# How to use?

Go to the releases section and download the whole zip file. Once unpacked, it is ready to run without installing!
Note: Windows Defender might recognize exe file as a virus. I assure you it is not! :)
Note2: Version v3.1 is in Croatian only, so please use stable version v2.0 until new version with English language pack.
