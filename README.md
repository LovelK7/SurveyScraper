# SurveyScraper
Short code to read, filter, export and apply magnetic declination to cave survey files for caving community

![surveyscraper_gui_EN_used](https://github.com/LovelK7/SurveyScraper/assets/114396834/c3c7ab33-67ae-4386-a392-28ab7c4f4d34)


# Why?

Currently, most commonly used digital cave survey tools (TopoDroid and PocketTopo) do not offer an export option for shots alone; instead, they export all data, including shots and splays. This necessitates post-processing in spreadsheet software, such as Excel. Additionally, while magnetic declination correction can be included, these tools do not calculate it for you, requiring you to use third-party software or an online calculator. This code performs this task for you, enabling you to process survey data more efficiently after every cave survey trip.
