# Why?

Currently, most used digital cave survey tools (TopoDroid and PocketTopo) do not allow export option with only shots present, but rather export all data (shots and splays), which require postprocessing in a spreadsheet software (i.e. Excel). Also, magnetic declination correction can be included, but it does not offer to calculate it for you (you again have to open and use third party software or online calculator). This code does this for you, and you can use it for managing survey data after each cave survey trip.
