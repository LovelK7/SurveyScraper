# Why?

Currently, most commonly used digital cave survey tools (TopoDroid and PocketTopo) do not offer an export option for shots alone; instead, they export all data, including shots and splays. This necessitates post-processing in spreadsheet software, such as Excel. Additionally, while magnetic declination correction can be included, these tools do not calculate it for you, requiring you to use third-party software or an online calculator. This code performs this task for you, enabling you to process survey data more efficiently after every cave survey trip.

# How to use?

Go to the releases section and download the whole zip file. Once unpacked, it is ready to run without installing!
Note: Windows Defender might recognize exe file as a virus. I assure you it is not! :)
